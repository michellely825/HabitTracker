## Project Overview

Habit tracker

- supports multiple users
- a user can:
  - create a user account
  - add a new habit
  - get their habits
  - get a habit's current streak (could be <= longest streak)
  - get a habit's longest streak
  - mark a habit as completed for the day
  - unmark a habit
  - delete a habit (marks it as inactive)
- a user can not:
  - update contents of a habit -> bc if they could, it would cause problems later on when calculating streaks?
  - update habit completion status for dates that have passed
  - access/update other user's habits

See [learnings.md](./notes/learnings.md) for notes on my process and decisions along the way
