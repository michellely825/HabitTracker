# Project Takeaways & Lessons Learned

My brain dump of conceptual thoughts, software principles I attempted to apply and lessons learned during development

## Historical vs. mutable data

**Context:** Completions table rows represent historical facts (e.g., "this habit was completed on this date") - they should only ever be inserted or deleted, never updated, since mutating a historical record risks losing information that can't be recovered.

**Design question:** If a user deletes a habit, should that cascade-delete its completion history or should the habit be soft-deleted instead (preserving history)?

**Decision:** Soft-delete via an `is_active` flag on `habits`. When a user "deletes" a habit, `is_active` is set to `False` rather than removing the row - this preserves the habit's full completion history rather than losing it to a cascade delete.

**Confirm with Victor:** whether `is_active`-based soft delete is the right approach here or if there's a more standard pattern for this kind of historical-data preservation.

## Backend logic

- my main.py file builds the app object which holds all routes
- every decorator runs once at startup and registers the route to app (not everytime a request comes in)
- the fx itself is not called yet until a request comes in
- after the whole file has been executed, uvicorn starts listening on port and waits for incoming requests
- let's say I defined two routes with same path & method, FastAPI doesn't overwrite the first with second; instead it registers both routes into the app obj and when a req comes in, it executes the first match

- Backends can send requests just like a browser can too!
- why? to talk to third party APIs to retrieve their data!
- if a website doesn't have an API, devs will sometimes web scrape

## HTTP Requests

An HTTP request has a few separate parts, and they don't mix:

The URL/route — POST /habits, tells FastAPI which function to run
Headers — metadata about the request, sits separately from the body. This is where Authorization: Bearer <token> lives
The body — the actual payload, in your case the JSON you're sending: {habit: "...", frequency: "..."}

Your BaseModel is specifically wired to look at #3, the body. It has no idea headers even exist — that's not what it's for. So you're right that your habit content comes in through the BaseModel, but the token needs a separate mechanism, because it lives in a separate part of the request.

## FastAPI

- FastAPI convention/rule: when a route parameter's type is a Pydantic BaseModel, FastAPI automatically knows to look for that data in the request body (parsed from JSON), rather than the URL (path or query).
- Type hints (`: str`) are not enforced by Python itself — but FastAPI uses Pydantic internally to enforce them for ALL type-hinted parameters, whether they're inside a BaseModel or just plain function parameters.
- What actually differs between a BaseModel param and a plain typed param isn't "is it validated" (both are) — it's WHERE FastAPI looks for the data:
  - plain param matching a `{}` in the URL path → path parameter
  - plain param not in the path → query parameter (`?username=...`)
  - BaseModel type → request body (JSON)
- BaseModel is the specific signal to FastAPI: "expect this data in the JSON request body, parse it, and validate/construct an instance of this class from it."

## Curl

- Curl ("client URL"): command-line tool used to transfer data to or from a server without any user interface AKA acts like the frontend!
  - takes a URL, fetches the raw data (HTML, JSON, or code), and dumps it directly into your terminal screen
- Basic anatomy of a curl command: `curl [options] [URL]`
- important flags
  - `-X`: tells the server how to handle the req (POST, DELETE, PUT)
    - GET is what curl does if you don't say otherwise
    - `curl -X DELETE https://example.com`
  - `-H`: header; Sends extra metadata to the server, like authentication tokens or the type of data you are sending.
    - `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN" https://example.com`
  - `-d`: data/payload: Sends a body of data to the server (used with POST or PUT). This automatically makes curl default to a POST request even if you skip the -X flag.
    - `curl -d "username=bob" https://example.com`
  - `-i`: include headers in output; Tells curl to show you the HTTP status code and response headers sent back by the server. This is arguably the most useful flag for backend debugging.
    - `curl -i https://example.com`

## Virtual Environments

what is it?

- a folder of installed packages and small scripts inside venv/bin (such as activate)
- these scripts have the exact absolute path baked into them via plain text
- let's say I manually rename the folder, the scripts will continue to point to old path which no longer exists -> problemo
  - lesson learned: don't rename a venv folder after creating, instead delete and recreate it

benefits

- avoids version clashes bc it isolates project packages/dependencies so they don't conflict with other probjects
- helps with reproducability
- keeps computer clean bc packages get installed into isolated folder preventing global clutter

db in venv

- when trying to set up my db i was unsure if i needed to re-install postgres into my venv (which alr existed globally)
- postgres is a standalone db server that does not live in venv
- venv is only for python packages!

## PyJWT

- JWT (jsonwebtokens): used for auth aka proving I am who I say I am to a server
- tokens are readable! they are not encrypted
- they consist of 3 parts separated by dots:
  1. header (metadata about the token aka the signing algo used)
  2. payload (user data)
  3. signature (proof that the token hasn't been tampered with) - this is the part that provides security by making tampering detectable
- Nobody can forge or tamper with it without knowing SECRET_KEY
- tokens are stateless meaning the server doesn't store them but the client does (usually via localStorage, memory or cookie); server verifies them purely through math algo calcs aka recomputing the expected signature
- cons:
  - since the server isn't tracking active tokens, it can't easily "revoke" one early via force log out thus a stolen token remains valid until it naturally expires
- jwt.encode() uses algorithm (Singular)
- jwt.decode() uses algorithms (Plural List)
- jwt decoder website: https://www.jwt.io/ (shows the decoded payload!)

## SQL

- if it's a SELECT: result = cursor.fetchone() or fetchall()
- if it's an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: conn.commit()

## fetchone()

- Returns ONE row from the last executed query, as a tuple — each item corresponds to one selected column, in the order selected.
  - e.g. `SELECT * FROM users` → `(user_id, username, password_hash)` → indexable via `result[0]`, `result[1]`, `result[2]`
  - e.g. `SELECT password_hash FROM users` → `('hash_value',)` — a one-item tuple (note trailing comma)
- If no matching row exists, returns `None` (not an empty tuple) — this is why `if not existing_user:` correctly catches "no row found."
- Indexing (`result[0]`, `result[2]`, etc.) relies on knowing the exact column order from the query — fragile if column order changes; `SELECT *` depends on table definition order.
- Contrast: `.fetchall()` returns ALL matching rows as a list of tuples — `.fetchone()` is essentially "give me the first tuple from that list, or None if empty."

## Return type hints (`-> int`)

- `def fx(param: str) -> int:` — the `-> int` is a **return type hint**, saying what type the function is expected to return.
- Similar concept to TypeScript's `function fx(param: string): number` — same idea (annotate expected types), different syntax (`->` in Python vs `:` in TS).
- Like parameter type hints, NOT enforced by plain Python at runtime — just documentation/IDE support, unless paired with a tool like `mypy`.

## Software Engineering Principles

- DRY
  - don't repeat yourself
  - implemented with get_connection fx that every route calls to create a connection with db

## Browser Dev Tools

- fetch(): built in js fx provided by the browser that is specifically designed for making HTTP reqs
